### Git Clone & Git Branch
NOTE: Make sure Git has been installed before using any git commands https://git-scm.com/ <br>

To start collaborating to the repository, you'll need to clone the repository to a local folder on your computer.
1. Create a folder on your computer, name it whatever you want
2. Use ' git clone {repository url} ' to copy the repository to the folder you created
3. Now you have a copy of the djanjo framework and can start working

To push your work to the repository, do not make changes in the master branch, create your own branch and push/commit changes from the branch.
1. Use ' git branch -c {branch_name} ' to create your branch
2. Use ' git branch ' to see all the branches (if any) that have been made <br> (the highlighted branch will be the one you are currently connected to)
3. Use ' git checkout {branch name} ' to switch to the branch you will be working on <br> (use ' git branch ' again to make sure you are on the correct branch)
4. Once you are on the correct branch, begin working in the files using your preferred IDE
5. To begin pushing/committing your changes to github, first add the changes using ' git add . ' <br> (this will queue up all the changes you have made) 
6. Then commit your changes to github. When you make a commit, you will also have to add a comment about your commit. Use ' git commit -m "{comment}" '
7. Aftering committing, push your changes to github by using ' git push origin head '. This will create a pull requests to the github repository from your branch.
