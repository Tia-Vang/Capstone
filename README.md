### Django Framework
To locally run the application:

3. Create virtual environment 'pip install pipenv'.....

(other dependencies: additional softwares: Bootstrap, somethingDB, Heroku)


### Git Branch
To collaborate to repository, do not make changes in the master or main branch. Create your own branch and push/commit changes from the branch.
1. Use ' git branch -c <branch name> ' to create your branch
2. Use ' git branch ' to see all the branches (if any) that have been made (the highlighted branch will be the one you are currently connected to)
3. Use ' git checkout <branch name> ' to switch to the branch you will be working on. (use ' git branch ' again to make sure you are on the correct branch)
4. Once you are on the correct branch, begin working in the files using your preferred IDE
5. To begin pushing/committing your changes to github, first add the changes using ' git add . ' (this will queue up all the changes you have made) 
6. Then commit your changes to github. When you make a commit, you will also have to add a comment about your commit. Use ' git commit -m "<comment>" '
7. Aftering committing, push your changes to github by using ' git push origin head '. This will createa pull requests to the github repository from your branch.
