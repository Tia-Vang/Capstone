        <p>Do you want to save money by using what you already have? 
        Do you want something nice to eat but feel too drained to go to the grocery store for one little thing? 
        Are you sick of scrolling through endless search results to find a recipe thatâ€™s right for you? 
        HomeChef may be just want you are looking for.
        </p> 

        <p>HomeChef was created by a group of UNCC students that wanted to 
        design a space where users can interact with one another to help provide 
        positive experiences in the kitchen through cooking techniques, recipes, 
        and likes.</p>

        <p>HomeChef is designed to make finding and cooking recipes simple and efficient.
        Hopefully, HomeChef can find the perfect recipe for you and your family while at
        the same time, saving you time and money. One of HomeChef's thousands of recipes
        may be the perfect breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner.
